Slack Command Line

This is a tool intended to be used with Slack as an Outgoing Web Hook. The idea is to give you access to some command line tools from the Slack chat room. Since command line tools are somewhat dangerous to expose, there are a number of restrictions in place.

You are also responsible for your own encryption.

This tool uses hapi.js as a simple REST API solution. There are a number of ways you can extend / use this app.

The first is by modifying the config.json file.
